The platform of testing would be Android, preferably Samsung's phone. 
The sign up function hasn't been made with alert for some issue like duplicating user id or user email, 
but it still have that in the back-end. So it is best not to make new account with these entries, which are also the existing account for testing: 
  - user1 
    jm@gmail.com
    1234
  - user2
    ch@gmail.com
    2345 

The detail screen will be activate when press on the app card in the Memories list, and swipe left is for deleting the entries.
